## 1.1 Goals of the Book and Contours of its Method

- This book introduces a hierarchical modeling technique which:
	- Makes accurate virtual machine models amenable to mathematical and experimental analysis
	- Links requirements capture to detailed design and coding
	- Provides on the fly a documentation which can be used for inspection, reuse, and maintenance

### 1.1.1 Stepwise Refinable Abstract Operational Modeling

- Using the method outlined in this book, system engineers can:
	- Derive a correct and complete human-centric task formulation called the `ground model`
		- The ground model is derived from the application-domain-governed understanding of a given problem and is developed through requirements analysis during the requirements capture process
		- Expressed in application-domain terms
			- The `application-domain` is the segment of reality for which a software system is developed and acts as the starting point for the actual-state analysis and creation of the domain model [Heinz ZÃ¼llighoven, Object-Oriented Construction Handbook, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/application-domain)
		- Constitutes a **binding contract** between the application domain expert (customer) and the system designer
	- Refine the ground model with more detailed descriptions developed from the design decisions that are made on the way to the executable code and documented by the intermediate models that make up a hierarchy of refined models
	- Links the most detailed specification to generated code that will be run on various platforms and implementing computers and has been shown to correctly solve the problem as formulated in the ground model, thus satisfying the contract with the customer
- You must maintain, from the ground model to the code, a uniform algorithmic view based on an abstract notion of run
- We deal with sets of local actions of multiple agents in a generalized way, defining an encompassing concept of basic actions as taking place in well-defined abstract local states and producing well-defined next states
- Locations play the role of abstract containers for values from given domains of objects, considered at whatever level of abstraction is given
- Objects residing in locations, together with the functions and relations defined on them, determine the abstract states the computation is about

### 1.1.2 Abstract Virtual Machine Notation

- There are 3 constituents of the ASM method
	-  Abstract State Machines
	- Ground model technique
	- Refinement principle
- ASMs provide a means for developing an operational system view which reflects the natural intuition of system behavior at the desired level of detail with the necessary degree of exactitude
- Synchronous and Asynchronous computational models allow you to view a system as a set of cooperating idealized mathematical machines which step by step perform local transformations of abstract global states
- Each single machine is driven by an agent (aka thread)
- We can view a machine as executing pseudo-code on arbitrary data structures with a clear notion of state and state transition
