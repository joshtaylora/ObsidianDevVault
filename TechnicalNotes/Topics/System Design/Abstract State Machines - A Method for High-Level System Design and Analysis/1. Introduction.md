## 1.1 Goals of the Book and Contours of its Method

- This book introduces a hierarchical modeling technique which:
	- Makes accurate virtual machine models amenable to mathematical and experimental analysis
	- Links requirements capture to detailed design and coding
	- Provides on the fly a documentation which can be used for inspection, reuse, and maintenance
